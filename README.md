> I am looking for friends who have experience as front-end engineers or UI/UX to work on a great project related to the open source community. Please email me if you are interested. An open-source platform with cloud features: Mix git + repository + hosting (github.com and heroku.com, ...)

---------

I am not hired so I don't have income, But I still help the open source community most of the time.
If you pay me a monthly donates or even once, I will be happy and I can continue to be stronger. Thanks anyway.
